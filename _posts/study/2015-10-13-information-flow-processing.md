#### Information Flow Processing(IFP)

- Information of Data no need to be stored into Database systems
    + Not deal with persistent data
    + Deal with transient data

- Data from different source 
    + Device sensors
    + Mobile phones
    + Web servers

- Contributions to this model come from different communities
    + distributed information systems
    + nusiness process automation
    + control systems
    + network monitoring
    + sensor networks
    + middleware in general

May be come from the publish-subsribe domain


##### Section 2 

describes the IFP domain in more detail, provides an initial description of the different technologies that have been developed to support it, and explains the need for combining the best of different worlds to fully support IFP applications. 

##### Section 3 

describes a framework to model and analyze the different aspects that are relevant for an IFP engine from its functional architecture, to its data and processing models, to the language it provides to express how information has to be processed, to its run-time architecture. 

##### Section 4 

We use this framework in Section 4 to describe and compare the state of the art in the field.

##### Section 5

Discussing the results of such classification in Section 5. 

##### Section 6

Finally, Section 6 reviews related work, while Section 7 provides some conclusive remarks and a list of open issues.

#### Online Machine Learning

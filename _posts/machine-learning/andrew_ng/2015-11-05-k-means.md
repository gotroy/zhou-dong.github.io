Input:

- K (number of clusters)
- Training set {$$x^{(1)},x^{(2)},...,x^{(m)} $$}

$$x^{(i)} \in R^n$$ (drop $$x_0 = 1$$ convention)

Step:

- Randomly initialize K cluster centroid $$\mu_1, \mu_2, ..., \mu_k \in R^n $$
- Repeat
    + for i=1 to m $$c^{(i)} := $$ index (from 1 to K) of cluster centroid closest to $$x_{(i)}, \text{which means find: } \min_k \|x^{(i)}-\mu_k\|$$
    + for k=1 to K $$\mu_k := $$ average (mean) of points assigned to cluster k
